# ✈️ AI Travel Planner

An AI-powered trip planning application that guides users through a conversational flow to build a complete, personalized travel itinerary.

The app asks one question at a time (origin, destination, budget, group size, duration, interests, etc.) and dynamically adapts the UI based on the AI’s response. Once all details are collected, it generates:

- At least **3 recommended hotels**
- A **multi-day itinerary** (matching trip duration)
- **Multiple activities per day**
- A clean, visual timeline of the trip
